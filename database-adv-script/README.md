This Directory contains the operations to perform to enable optimization, partitioning, and normalization, complex queries for efficient data.

## Write Complex Queries with Joins
Using the INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN to write complex queries to retrive data from database.

## Practice Subqueries
Query tables in subquery format using the correlated and non-correlated

## Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.
Analyze data with aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT) and window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) for advanced reporting.

## Identify and create indexes to improve query performance.
Using INDEX for reasarching data faster to optimize the flow, create INDEX for each frequently used columns from the user, booking, and property table.

## Refactor complex queries to improve performance.
Optimize queries by reducing unnecessary joins, selecting only required columns, and leveraging indexes.
